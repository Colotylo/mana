[E-mail instructions as of May 28, 2020.  Revise this when MANA is more stable.]

Hi Zhengji,
    Here is a revised version of my instructions for running MANA.
I'm also adding these instructions to:
      $MANA_ROOT/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/INSTALL

The main pointers are:

MANA at github:
  https://github.com/mpickpt/mana/tree/refactoring
  (the refactoring branch of https://github.com/mpickpt/mana ).
and MANA documentation:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pT25gvMNeT1Vz4SU6Gp4Hx9MGLfkK8ZK-sSOwtu5R50/edit

Eventually, we'll have a better Makefile, and scripts for this:
  mpi_mana_launch, mpi_mana_restart, mpi_mana_status.
But for now, we're still modifying it.

At this time, the steps to build MANA (on Cori) are roughly as follows.

  module unload craype-hugepages2M
  # Modify the salloc command according to your needs:
  salloc -N 1 -C haswell -q interactive -t 03:00:00
  git clone https://github.com/mpickpt/mana
  cd mana
  # Development branch.  (Eventually, the 'master' branch will be preferred.)
  git checkout refactoring
  ./configure
  make -j  # Build in source directory: create bin, lib directories.
  pushd contrib/mpi-proxy-split  # Go to plugin directory.
  (cd test && make -j)
  make install
  pushd  # Go back to the MANA root directory
  make -j  # Make it again. The plugin 'make' added an extra file to core DMTCP.
  pushd  # Go back to plugin directory: mpi-proxy-split
  cd test # We're now in:  contrib/mpi-proxy-split/test

And then to test it, my instructions here are based on our very informal
notes on Cori at:
  ~gdc0/public/commands-wednesday.history
The working notes may change, and we'll then propagate the changes to these instructions.)

Roughly, to test MANA, do:
  export MANA_ROOT=$HOME/mana  # Adjust for your directory.
  cd $MANA_ROOT/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/test
  make tidy # Remove old ckpt files from a previous session.
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_coordinator --mpi -q -q --exit-on-last --daemon
  # This does interval checkpointing every 5 seconds.
  srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_launch -i5 --host `hostname` --no-gzip --join --disable-dl-plugin --with-plugin $PWD/../libmana.so ./mpi_hello_world.mana.exe
  # [ creates ckpt:   ls ckpt_rank_*/ckpt_*.dmtcp ]
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_coordinator --mpi -q -q --exit-on-last --daemon
  srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_restart --host `hostname` --join --mpi ckpt_rank_*/ckpt_*.dmtcp

As I said earlier, we will later simplify all of this with a better Makefile
and scripts for launch, restart, and status.  But right now, this branch
is still under development.

Best,
- Gene
